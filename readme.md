# Dotfiles

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo to `~/dotfiles`.
2. Source the `master` file:

```sh
source ~/dotfiles/master
```

3. That should be all you need to do! The `master` file will pull in all the
other files.

## New Mac Smell

To get a fresh install of macOS up to speed, once you've followed the installation
steps above, run `./nms` to install some stuff automatically. More to come
when I can be assed.
